# Flask YouTube mock API

Small project that mocks a basic CRUD API from Youtube. Project was done with Flask, following tutorial from Tech With Tim.

# Setup and Run
Install all dependencies by running:
```bash
pip install -r REQUIREMENTS.txt
```

In a CLI window, go to the directory and run `main.py`:
```bash
cd path/to/dir
python main.py
```

You can now then make API calls to `127.0.0.1:5000`.

You can also run test.py in another terminal to test the endpoints:
```bash
cd path/to/dir
python test.py
```
